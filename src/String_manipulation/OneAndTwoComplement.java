	 * 1’s and 2’s complement of a Binary Number
		Given a Binary Number as string, print its 1’s and 2’s complements.

		1’s complement of a binary number is another binary number obtained by toggling all bits in it, 
		i.e., transforming the 0 bit to 1 and the 1 bit to 0.

		Examples:

		1's complement of "0111" is "1000"
		1's complement of "1100" is  "0011" 
	
		2’s complement of a binary number is 1 added to the 1’s complement of the binary number.
		Examples:

		2's complement of "0111" is  "1001"
		2's complement of "1100" is  "0100"
